Hello everyone,
My name is Nghia.

Last week, my group presented "Loss of control".
Today, I continue to talk about "Shortage of Transparency" and "Virtual Machine Related Challenges".
 
The first is "Malicious Insiders/Unauthorized Internal Access" content.
<!-- !Malicious Insiders/Unauthorized Internal Access -->

Threats amplify due to the convergence of IT services under a single management domain; General lack of transparency into CSP processes \& procedures; less visibility into the hiring standard and practices of cloud employeesâ€™ lead to adversary.

A malicious insider, such as a system administrator, in an improperly designed cloud scenario can have access to potentially sensitive information.

<!-- we have results -->
Results: 
Espionage
Hackers
Brand damage
Financial impact
Productivity losses
Impact on business continuity
Traditional security and disaster recovery

Next about "Ambiguous ownership and responsibility"
<!-- !Ambiguous ownership \& responsibility -->

Lack of clear ownership and defined responsibilities for data protection may responsibility result in failure of meeting regulatory and of data legal obligations.

<!--  -->
Authentication and Authorization: Cloud building organizations has to authenticate each and every person who is using the cloud from the cloud utilizing organization.

They will provide authorizations to the users based on the service usage and payment.

The cloud building organization has to prevent unauthorized users by checking authorization.

The cloud utilizing organization has to remove or disable accounts of the ex-employees on day-to-day basis.

<!-- @ Virtual Machine Related Challenges -->
Virtualization refers to the logical abstraction of computing resources from physical constraints. One representative example of virtualization technology is the virtual machine.

Despite of its substantial benefits, this technology also introduces security and privacy risks in the cloud computing environment.

<!-- ! Security threats sourced from host -->
Security threats sourced from host

The host machine there are implications that allow the host to monitor and communicate with VM applications up running.

It is more necessary to strictly protect the host machines than protecting distinctive VMs.

The enterprise can co-locate applications with different trust levels on the same host and can defend VMs in a shared multi-tenant environment.

This enables enterprises to maximize the benefits of virtualization.


<!--  -->

The host can influence the VMs in the following ways:

The host can start, shut down, pause, and restart VMs.

Monitoring and configuration of resources which are available to the VMs, these include: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of VMs.

Adjust the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the amount and number of virtual disks, and several virtual network interfaces that are available to a VM.

Monitoring the applications which are running inside the VM.

View, copy, and possibly modify, data stored on the VM's virtual disks.

Monitoring VMs could violate security and privacy, but could also be prevented by isolating security tools from an untrusted VM.

Communication between VMs: Sharing resources between VMs may strip security of each VM.

Denial of Service (DoS): A DoS attack is a trying to denial services that provide to authorize users.
<!--  -->
For example when trying to access site we see that due to overloading of the server with the requests to access the site, we are unable to access the site and observe an error. This happens when the number of requests that can be handled by a server exceeds its capacity, the Dos attack marking carting part of clouds inaccessible to the users.
