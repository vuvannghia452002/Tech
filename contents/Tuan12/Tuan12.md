\subsection{Insider Threats}

Insider threats is the most concerned cybersecurity
problem which is poorly addressed by widely used security
solutions \cite{singh2022systematic}. A case in point would be businesses may be exposed to security hazards from both internal and external sources.

Security threats can come from inside or outside of an organization. The attacks from insiders, be they from employees, suppliers, or other companies legitimately connected to a companyâ€™s computer system, pose a more pernicious threat than external attacks. These insiders have knowledge of the internal workings of the organization, and full
possession of all the rights and privileges required to mount an attack that outsiders lack. Consequently, insiders can make their attacks look like normal operations \cite{gheyas2016detection}.

% One of the most recent case examples to share would be the one where 27,000 of client records were exposed by Barclays bank claimed by a whistleblower employee \cite{ashford2014barclays}.
