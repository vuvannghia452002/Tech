**3. Contribution to Group Work**

During the midterm period, my contribution to our group work primarily revolved around synthesizing the knowledge gained from the above papers and integrating it into our group survey. I played a key role in analyzing how deep learning, NLP, and RL techniques could be applied to our survey topic, which focuses on the role of AI in healthcare diagnostics. By leveraging insights from these papers, I proposed potential methodologies and algorithms that could enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in healthcare settings.

**4. Relationship to Group Survey**

Each of the papers I've read directly relates to our group survey on AI in healthcare diagnostics:

- The paper on deep learning for image recognition informs our understanding of how convolutional neural networks can be employed to analyze medical images such as X-rays and MRIs for diagnostic purposes.
- The NLP paper is relevant as it sheds light on how natural language processing techniques can be utilized to extract valuable information from medical texts, patient records, and research papers, aiding in diagnosis and decision-making.
- Finally, the reinforcement learning paper introduces the concept of learning from feedback, which has implications for optimizing treatment plans and personalized medicine through adaptive learning systems.
