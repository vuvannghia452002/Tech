<!--


**[1] Paper Title: "Deep Learning for Image Recognition"**

- **Main Contribution:** This paper presents an in-depth exploration of deep learning techniques for image recognition tasks. It covers various architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their applications in image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- **Personal Judgement:** I found this paper extremely insightful in understanding the fundamentals of deep learning applied to image recognition. The detailed explanations of CNN architectures and their real-world applications were particularly valuable.

**[2] Paper Title: "Natural Language Processing: State of the Art"**

- **Main Contribution:** This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing (NLP). It covers topics such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer models like BERT and GPT.
- **Personal Judgement:** As someone interested in language processing tasks, I found this paper to be an excellent resource. It not only gave me a comprehensive understanding of modern NLP techniques but also inspired me to delve deeper into transformer architectures.

**[3] Paper Title: "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"**

- **Main Contribution:** This seminal paper introduces the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and its foundational concepts. It covers topics such as Markov decision processes, value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning.
- **Personal Judgement:** While challenging, this paper provided a solid foundation in RL concepts. It clarified many intricate details of RL algorithms and their applications, sparking my interest in exploring RL further.
