2. Its main contribution

3. Your personal judgements or comments on the content of the paper

4. Show how this paper is related to your group survey

Then

5. Submit your report (in pdf file format) via Teams assignment. If you have proofs of work or supported materials (e.g. portfolio, referred papers, simulation tools, data, etc.), please collect all related files, zip them, and enclose the unique ZIP file with the report.

**Note:**

+) Your report should have a reference section that includes all above referred papers.

+) A numerical citation style (e.g. IEEE) should be applied to your report.

+) Please ignore the midterm-exam date set by our school if it is available.
